    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Virtually every beer-battered fish recipe looks crispy coming out of the fryer, and some even stay crispy for a few minutes, but then the inevitable sogginess sets in. Well, with this simple formula, and a few easy tricks, you can achieve a fried fish where the last bite is as crisp as the first. The keys are keeping your batter really cold and patting your fish really dry. Serve over a bed of salt 'n vinegar chips with tartar sauce and lemon.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>For the Batter:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup self-rising flour</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons rice flour</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>For the Fish:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>4 (6 ounce) cod fillets, fully thawed if frozen</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons rice flour, or as needed</li>
                <li>salt to taste</li>
                <li>1 cup lager-style beer, or more as needed</li>
                <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
            </ul>
       <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk self-rising flour, rice flour, and baking powder together in a bowl. Freeze until ready to use.</li>
            <li>Pat fish as dry as possible. Cut pieces lengthwise to get eight 1-inch thick strips. Place rice flour on a plate and season with salt. Dust fish lightly with the mixture and shake off excess. Cover a plate with crinkled foil to make a quick drying rack; place fish on top.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Pour beer into the flour mixture and whisk, adding more as needed, until batter is the consistency of thick pancake batter. Dip fish pieces into the batter to coat; lift out and let excess drip off.</li>
            <li>Fry fish in batches until golden brown, dunking occasionally if needed, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
